# 1 Introduction

This specification defines a set of AMQP extensions for interaction with event
stream engines, including annotations for partition selection and filter
definitions for indicating offsets into an extension stream to which a link
shall be attached.

In the context of this specification, the term "event stream engine" describes a
particular archetype of AMQP node that manages sequences of events (messages) in
an ordered log structure.

Event logs differ from queue-like structures in that they do not track message
delivery state across competing receivers. The message delivery state is instead
tracked for each link at its terminus. When attaching a `receive` AMQP link, the
receiver MAY indicate an initial offset into the retained event log. The
delivery of events then progresses in log order from that initial offset to more
recently added events. Omitting the offset results in delivery of events added
after attaching the link.

Event stream engines conforming to this specification MAY implement any of the
capabilities defined here and they MUST implement the default behaviors defined
here when those capabilities are not explicitly used.

# 2 Concepts and default behaviors

The following terminology is used in this specification to clarify roles. These
definitions are narrower than their use in the core AMQP specification.

- `producer` is the sender of events into the event log.
- `consumer` is the receiver of events from the event log.
- `event log node` is where AMQP links of senders and receivers attach.


## 2.1 Partition support

An event log managed by the event stream node MAY be split into multiple
parallel partitions that are reachable under the same network address. A single
event log might also be shared by multiple AMQP containers/nodes that each have
a separate network address and are each responsible for one or more partitions.

The association between a producer/consumer and a partition MAY be chosen using
link properties when the link is being attached. The bi-directional negotiation
capabilities of AMQP apply here: A consumer MAY request being associated with a
particular partition, but the responding event log node MAY also assign a
partition if none has been requested.

A producer's `send` link being attached to an event log node MAY request
association with a specific partition using the [`event-streams-partition` link
property](#211-event-streams-partition-link-property). If the requested
partition does not exist, attaching the link MUST be rejected by the event log
node. The event log node MAY assign a partition when none has been requested. It
MUST NOT assign a partition other than the one that has been requested.

If no partition is assigned, the default behavior MUST be for a `send` link to
be partition agnostic and for any partition-related hints to flow via delivery
annotations, which are defined further below in this section.

A consumer's `receive` link being attached to an event log node MAY request
association with a specific partition using the the [`event-streams-partition`
link property](#211-event-streams-partition-link-property). If the requested
partition does not exist, attaching the link MUST fail. If the event log is
partitioned and no association has been requested, the event log node MUST
associate a partition with the link.

For both `send` and `receive` links, the effective associated partition MUST be
expressed with the [`event-streams-partition` link
property](#211-event-streams-partition-link-property) set by the event log node.

### 2.1.1 event-streams-partition link property

The `event-streams-partition` link property is a `symbol` value and describes
the partition with which the link is associated. When set by the producer or
consumer, the property value is a request for association with the given
partition. When set by the event log node, the value is the effective
association.

When not set for a producer 'send' link, the link is partition-agnostic.

### 2.1.2 event-streams-partition delivery annotation

The `event-streams-partition` delivery annotation is a `symbol` value and
describes the partition to which the message carrying it MUST be routed or from
which partition is has been retrieved.

If the link over which a message is routed is not partition agnostic with or if
the link is not associated with the exact same partition, the transfer MUST be
rejected.

If the event log is partitioned, the delivery annotation MUST be added by the
event log node before delivery to consumers. A consumer SHOULD strip the
annotation before forwarding it.

### 2.1.3 event-streams-group-key message annotation

The `event-streams-key` message annotation is a `string` value and
is a grouping key that identifies events that are related and SHOULD therefore
be treated as a group for partitioning purposes.

This is an annotation and therefore differs from the core message property
`group-id` by allowing overrides as messages get routed through multiple
partitioned intermediaries where partitioning concerns might vary.

When set by the producer and used over a partition agnostic link, the value of
the annotation MAY be used by the event log to associate the message with a
partition. If the key is used in this way, the event log SHOULD associate the
same partition with the same key at all times until the number of partitions
changes.

# 2.2 Stream delivery offsets and filters 

As stated in the introduction, event logs differ from queue-like structures in
that they only track message delivery state at the AMQP link level. While
attaching a `receive` AMQP link, the consumer MAY indicate a desired initial
offset into the retained log or some other condition based on which events
become eligible for delivery. The desired offset is expressed using an AMQP
filter expression.

# 2.2.1 Delivery annotations

The delivery filter expressions refer to a set of delivery annotations defined
in the following. These delivery annotations MUST be added by the event log to
all messages delivered to consumers.

# 2.2.1.1 event-streams-offset

The `event-streams-offset` delivery annotation property is a `symbol` expression
whose internal syntax is opaque to the receiver. Receivers MUST NOT interpret or
construct offset values. The offset value represents the relative position of
the event to the beginning of the log.

Even though the syntax is opaque, the chosen syntax MUST ensure that the
lexicographical rank of the `event-streams-offset` of any event in the log MUST
be greater than the lexicographical rank of any other event preceding it in the
order of the log.

Receivers learn about offset values either by obtaining the runtime information
of a partition, which contains the offset of the most recently added event, or
by retaining the value of the last `event-streams-offset` delivery annotation
property they read from the partition.

For use with [delivery filter expressions](#222-delivery-filters), the reserved
values MAY be used as constants for comparand values:

- "@earliest" is smaller than all existing offsets in the log.
- "@latest" is greater than all existing offsets in the log.

# 2.2.1.2 event-streams-timestamp

The `event-streams-timestamp` delivery annotation property is a timestamp
expression and reflects the absolute UTC instant when the event has been added
to the event log. This is different from the `creation-time` message property
that is set by the sender.

Multiple events added to the log around the same instant MAY have identical
timestamps due to the UTC clock resolution concerns. The timestamp only serves
as a filter criterion to determine a desired offset into the stream, but MUST
NOT be used to determine the order of events.

A distributed event log implementation where the ownership of a log changes
between different hosts and where clocks might not be fully synchronized MAY
record `event-streams-timestamp` values that reflect the existing clock skew,
meaning that some events that appear later in the log than a given event might
yet carry earlier UTC timestamps.

# 2.2.2 Delivery filters

A delivery filter specifies which events are eligible for delivery from the
event log. The delivery filter is provided as a source filter during link
attach.

Delivery filters MAY be expressed using any AMQP filter expression that is
supported by the source (the event log node). This specification defines two
simplified filters that allow for a conforming implementation without having to
implement the full [AMQP filter expressions](#filtex-v10) specification in a
conforming fashion.

The source filter MUST be evaluated against the retained events in the log from
earliest to latest. Events matching the source expression are eligible for
delivery.

# 2.2.2.1 event-streams-delivery-annotations filter

The `event-streams-delivery-annotations` filter type applies to AMQP
delivery annotations section (AMQP 3.2.2). The filter evaluates to true if all
annotations enclosed in the filter expression match the respective
delivery annotation map entries in the message.

Only the [`event-streams-offset`](#2211-event-streams-offset) and/or
[`event-streams-timestamp`](#2212-event-streams-timestamp) delivery annotation
properties are eligible to be used with this filter.

The property values match the given values in the filter expression, if the value
of the property is greater or equal to the value given in the filter expression.

``` XML
<type name="event-streams-delivery-annotations-filter" class="restricted" source="amqp:map" provides="filter">
<descriptor name="amqp:event-streams-delivery-annotations-filter" code="0x00000000:0x00000200"/>
</type> 
```

The filter-type is âamqp:event-streams-delivery-annotations-filterâ, with
type-code 0x00000000:0x00000200

# 2.2.2.2 event-streams-sql filter 

The event streams SQL filter expression is a constrained subset of the SQL filter
expression defined in [AMQP filter expressions [FILTEX, 6]](#filtex-v10).

The grammar builds on the grammar defined for those SQL filters, but is
constrained as follows:

```
predicate ::=  <boolean_constant> |
              | <expression> <comparison-operator> <expression>
              | <predicate> <binary-logical-operator> <predicate>
expression ::= <constant> | <field_value>  
constant   ::= <string_constant> | <integer_constant>
field_value := <field>
field ::= <section> â.â<field_name>
section ::= { âmessage_annotationsâ | âmâ }
```

This grammar subset allows for a minimal implementation that is limited to
evaluating the delivery annotation properties defined here while being
interoperable with the full SQL filter syntax.

Examples:

- Start from event at offset "a4c5" exclusively: `m.event-streams-offset > '100'`
- Start from event at offset "a4c5" inclusively: `m.event-streams-offset >= '100'`
- Start from event received after the timestamp: `m.event-streams-timestamp > 1585672841`


``` XML
 <type name="event-streams-sql-filter" class="restricted" source="sql-filter" provides="filter">
<descriptor name="amqp:event-streams-sql-filter" code="0x00000000:0x00000201"/> 
</type>
```

The filter-type is âamqp:event-streams-sql-filterâ, with type-code 0x00000000:0x00000201


## 2.3 Link ownership

An implementation MAY constrain the number of concurrent receivers that can
receive from a log or its partitions.

In scenarios where a group of multiple concurrent event processors want to
receive events from a partitioned event log and where they use an external
consensus mechanism to agree on which event processor owns which partition, it
is desireable to restrict each partition to one (the owning) receiver from the
group and for event processors to "steal" ownership of the partition as
assignments amongst the group change.

This specification does not prescribe any algorithm or strategy for reaching
such consensus, but only a mechanism for realizing its outcome:

For an event log that is partitioned, a link MAY be associated with a partition
and a consumer group when the respective link properties are provided during
`attach`. For the combination of partition and consumer group, the node
maintains a `long`-valued `epoch` counter, which is seeded with zero and
returned in the `event-streams-epoch` link property to the receiver during a
successful attempt to attach.

Any subsequent attempt to attach a link with the same combination of partition
and consumer group link property values will be rejected while there is an
active link and unless the newly attaching receiver provides an epoch counter
greater than the current epoch counter value using the `event-streams-epoch`
link property. If that condition is true, the new epoch counter value is
recorded, any existing link for the given partition and consumer group is closed
by the node, and the new link is attached.

Whenever the link for a partition within a group is closed by the receiver and
therefore no links remain, the respective epoch counter is reset to zero.  

### 2.2.1 event-streams-consumer-group link property

The `event-streams-consumer-group` link property is a `string` value that
identifies a group of consumers and provides a scope for the epoch counter.

An implementation MAY require for the group identifier to correspond to a
configured item on the event stream engine and otherwise refuse to attach the
link.

### 2.2.1 event-streams-epoch link property

The `event-streams-epoch` link property is a `long` integer value and describes
the ownership epoch for the link relative to the consumer group and while at
least one link is attached to the partition within the given consumer group.

If no link is attached to node for the given partition and group, the epoch
counter SHOULD be reset to zero.
