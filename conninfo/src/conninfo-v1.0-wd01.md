# 2 Overview

This specification recommends a standard way for an AMQP container to reveal information about
itself and its operating environment to its partner.   This allows a container to expose information
that would be useful for problem diagnosis, such as process identifiers and software version
information.

This specification is equally appropriate for AMQP container fulfilling the role of clients or
servers, or containers supporting a peer-to-peer scenario.

-------

# 3 Definitions

An AMQP host that implements this specification MUST provide the following entry in the properties
field of the AMQP `open` performative [[AMQP-v1.0](#AMQP-v1.0)]. The key of the entry MUST be the symbol
`connection-info`. The value of the entry MUST be of type `fields`.

The following key values have defined meaning. An implementation MAY choose to omit a key from the map.
An implementation MAY also include keys of its own. If an implementation receives a key from its partner
that it does not recognise, it SHOULD ignore it.

# 3.1 connection-info

`<type name="connection-info" class="restricted" source="fields"/>`

The content of `connection-info` allows the container to provide information about itself and its operating
environment to its partner.

**Table 1-1. connection-info**

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `process-identifier` | The value of the process-identifier MUST be an AMQP string. The purpose of the value is to identify the process running this AMQP host. It is RECOMMENDED that this is an operating system PID. |
| `network-host` | The value of network-host MUST be an AMQP string. The purpose of the value is to identify the host running the AMQP container in a way that assists those fault finding within a system. This value MAY be a hostname, fully qualified hostname or IP address. The value MAY be network resolvable by the AMQP peer but the peer MUST NOT rely on this. |
| `amqp-product` | The value of amqp-product MUST be an AMQP string and is a `product-string`. It provides details of the software product(s) that provide the AMQP implementation. It MAY identify multiple products. By convention, the products are listed in order of their significance for identifying the product. |
| `product` | The value of product MUST be an AMQP string and is a product-string. It provides details of the software product(s) that is the end-user application. It MAY identify multiple products. By convention, the products are listed in order of their significance for identifying the application. |
| `platform` | The value of platform MUST be an AMQP string and is a product-string. It exists to expose details of a productâs runtime platform. This typically identify the operating system, Java/.NET runtimes etc. It MAY identify multiple products. By convention, the products are listed in order of their significance. |

# 3.2 product-string

`<type name="product-string" class="restricted" source="string"/>`

The content of the `product-string` MUST adopt the content structure of the `User-Agent` header (defined by 
[[RFC2616](#rfc2616)]) and commonly implemented by Web Browsing software. The field MAY contain multiple product tokens
and comments identifying the product and any sub-products which form a significant part of the system. By convention, 
the product tokens are listed in order of their significance

Formally, the content of `product-string` MUST conform to this ABNF production rule:
 
```
product-string = 1*( product | comment ) 
```

where symbols `product`, `comment`, and the ABNF grammar itself are as defined by [[RFC2616](#rfc2616)].

## Non normative examples:

```
ApacheQpidJMS/0.36
ApacheQpidJMS/0.36 ApacheQpidProton/0.45 (build 12345)
```

# 4 Safety, Security, and Data Protection Considerations
(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

# 5 Conformance
(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).

See "Guidelines to Writing Conformance Clauses":
